encryption,"Incryptography, encryption is the process ofencodinginformation. This process converts the original representation of the information, known asplaintext, into an alternative form known asciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor. For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses apseudo-randomencryptionkeygenerated by analgorithm. It is possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key, but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users. Historically, various forms of encryption have been used to aid in cryptography. Early encryption techniques were often utilized in military messaging. Since then, new techniques have emerged and become commonplace in all areas of modern computing.[103]Modern encryption schemes utilize the concepts ofpublic-keyandsymmetric-key.[103]Modern encryption techniques ensure security because modern computers are inefficient at cracking the encryption."
event,"An action or occurrence recognized by software, often originatingasynchronouslyfrom the external environment, that may behandledby the software. Because an event is an entity which encapsulates the action and the contextual variables triggering the action, the acrostic mnemonic ""ExecutionVariableEncapsulatingNamedTrigger"" is often used to clarify the concept."

Heapsort can be thought of as an improvedselection sort: like that algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. The improvement consists of the use of aheapdata structure rather than a linear-time search to find the maximum.[116]"

operating system(OS),"Aprogramming paradigmbased on the concept of ""objects"", which can containdata, in the form offields(often known asattributesorproperties), and code, in the form ofprocedures(often known asmethods). A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of ""this"" or ""self""). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[151][152]OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones areclass-based, meaning that objects areinstancesofclasses, which also determine theirtypes."

An ordered list of parameters is usually included in thedefinition of a subroutine, so that, each time the subroutine is called, its arguments for that call are evaluated, and the resulting values can be assigned to the corresponding parameters."
postcondition,Any auxiliary or ancillary device connected to or integrated within a computer system and used to send information to or retrieve information from the computer. Aninput devicesends data or instructions to the computer; anoutput deviceprovides output from the computer to the user; and aninput/output deviceperforms both functions.
precondition,"Is anobjectin manyprogramming languagesthat stores amemory address. This can be that of another value located incomputer memory, or in some cases, that ofmemory-mappedcomputer hardware. A pointerreferencesa location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is known asdereferencingthe pointer. As an analogy, a page number in a book's index could be considered a pointer to the corresponding page; dereferencing such a pointer would be done by flipping to the page with the given page number and reading the text found on that page. The actual format and content of a pointer variable is dependent on the underlyingcomputer architecture."
primary storage,"Incomputer programming, a condition orpredicatethat must always be true just after the execution of some section of code or after an operation in aformal specification.

Python,"Is alogic programminglanguage associated withartificial intelligenceandcomputational linguistics.[164][165][166]Prolog has its roots infirst-order logic, aformal logic, and unlike many otherprogramming languages, Prolog is intended primarily as adeclarative programminglanguage: the program logic is expressed in terms ofrelations, represented as facts andrules.  Acomputationis initiated by running aqueryover these relations.[167]"

record,"Indigital numeral systems, the number of uniquedigits, including the digit zero, used to represent numbers in apositionalnumeral system. For example, in the decimal/denary system (the most common system in use today) the radix (base number) is ten, because it uses the ten digits from 0 through 9, and all other numbers are uniquely specified by positional combinations of these ten base digits; in thebinary systemthat is the standard incomputing, the radix is two, because it uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to uniquely specify each number."
recursion,"A record (also called a structure,struct, or compound data) is a basicdata structure. Records in adatabaseorspreadsheetare usually called ""rows"".[173][174][175][176]"
reference,"Occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging fromlinguisticstologic. The most common application of recursion is inmathematicsandcomputer science, where afunctionbeing defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no infinite loop or infinite chain of references can occur."
reference counting,"Is a value that enables a program to indirectly access a particulardatum, such as avariable's value or arecord, in thecomputer'smemoryor in some otherstorage device.  The reference is said to refer to the datum, and accessing the datum is calleddereferencingthe reference."

relational database,"(rarelynon-regression testing[177]) is re-runningfunctionalandnon-functional teststo ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change.[178]If not, that would be called aregression. Changes that may require regression testing includebugfixes, software enhancements,configurationchanges, and even substitution ofelectronic components.[179]As regression test suites tend to grow with each found defect, test automation is frequently involved. Sometimes achange impact analysisis performed to determine an appropriate subset of tests (non-regression analysis[180])."

Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use ofrobots, as well ascomputer systemsfor their perception, control,sensory feedback, andinformation processing. The goal of robotics is to design intelligent machines that can help and assist humans in their day-to-day lives and keep everyone safe."
router,"The difference between the result produced by a givenalgorithmusing exact arithmetic and the result produced by the same algorithm using finite-precision, rounded arithmetic.[186]Rounding errors are due to inexactness in the representation of real numbers and the arithmetic operations done with them. This is a form ofquantization error.[187]When using approximationequationsor algorithms, especially when using finitely many digits to represent real numbers (which in theory have infinitely many digits), one of the goals ofnumerical analysisis toestimatecomputation errors.[188]Computation errors, also callednumerical errors, include bothtruncation errorsand roundoff errors.[189]"
routing table,"Anetworking devicethat forwardsdata packetsbetweencomputer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on theInternet.  Data sent through the internet, such as aweb pageoremail, is in the form of data packets.   A packet is typicallyforwardedfrom one router to another router through the networks that constitute aninternetwork(e.g. the Internet) until it reaches its destinationnode.[190]"
run time,"Incomputer networkinga routing table, or routing information base (RIB), is adata tablestored in arouteror anetwork hostthat lists the routes to particular network destinations, and in some cases,metrics(distances) associated with those routes. The routing table contains information about thetopology of the networkimmediately around it."
run time error,"Runtime, run time, or execution time is the final phase of acomputer program'slife cycle, in which the code is beingexecutedon the computer'scentral processing unit(CPU) asmachine code. In other words, ""runtime"" is the running phase of a program."
search algorithm,"Aruntime erroris detected after or during the execution (running state) of a program, whereas acompile-timeerror is detected by thecompilerbefore the program is ever executed.Type checking,register allocation,code generation, and code optimization are typically done at compile time, but may be done at runtime depending on the particular language and compiler. Many other runtime errors exist and are handled differently by differentprogramming languages, such asdivision by zeroerrors, domain errors,array subscript out of boundserrors,arithmetic underflowerrors, several types of underflow andoverflowerrors, and many other runtime errors generally considered as software bugs which may or may not be caught and handled by any particular computer language."
secondary storage,"Anyalgorithmwhich solves thesearch problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in thesearch spaceof a problemdomain, either withdiscrete or continuous values."
selection sort,"Also known asexternal memoryorauxiliary storage, differs from primary storage in that it is not directly accessible by the CPU. The computer usually uses itsinput/outputchannels to access secondary storage and transfer the desired data to primary storage. Secondary storage is non-volatile (retaining data when power is shut off). Modern computer systems typically have two orders of magnitude more secondary storage than primary storage because secondary storage is less expensive."
semantics,"Is anin-placecomparisonsorting algorithm. It has anO(n2)time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similarinsertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly whereauxiliary memoryis limited."
sequence,"Inprogramming language theory, semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning ofprogramming languages. It does so by evaluating the meaning ofsyntacticallyvalidstringsdefined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certainplatform, hence creating amodel of computation."
serializability,"Inmathematics, a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed andorderdoes matter.  Like aset, it containsmembers(also calledelements, orterms).  The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called thelengthof the sequence.  Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and order does matter.  Formally, a sequence can be defined as afunctionwhose domain is either the set of thenatural numbers(for infinite sequences) or the set of the firstnnatural numbers (for a sequence of finite lengthn).

The position of an element in a sequence is itsrankorindex; it is the natural number for which the element is the image. The first element has index 0 or 1, depending on the context or a specific convention.  When a symbol is used to denote a sequence, thenth element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol withnas subscript; for example, thenth element of theFibonacci sequenceFis generally denotedFn.

For example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter 'M' first and 'Y' last.  This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y).  Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence.  Sequences can befinite, as in these examples, orinfinite, such as the sequence of allevenpositive integers(2, 4, 6, ...).  Incomputingandcomputer science, finite sequences are sometimes calledstrings,wordsorlists, the different names commonly corresponding to different ways to represent them incomputer memory; infinite sequences are calledstreams.  The empty sequence ( ) is included in most notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context."
serialization,"Inconcurrency controlofdatabases,[191][192]transaction processing(transaction management), and varioustransactionalapplications (e.g.,transactional memory[193]andsoftware transactional memory), both centralized anddistributed, atransaction scheduleisserializableif its outcome (e.g., the resulting database state) is equal to the outcome of its transactions executed serially, i.e. without overlapping in time. Transactions are normally executed concurrently (they overlap), since this is the most efficient way. Serializability is the major correctness criterion for concurrent transactions' executions[citation needed]. It is considered the highest level ofisolationbetweentransactions, and plays an essential role inconcurrency control. As such it is supported in all general purpose database systems.Strong strict two-phase locking(SS2PL) is a popular serializability mechanism utilized in most of the database systems (in various variants) since their early days in the 1970s."
service level agreement,"Is the process of translatingdata structuresorobjectstate into a format that can be stored (for example, in afileor memorybuffer) or transmitted (for example, across anetworkconnection link) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment).[194]When the resulting series of bits is reread according to the serialization format, it can be used to create a semantically identical clone of the original object. For many complex objects, such as those that make extensive use ofreferences, this process is not straightforward. Serialization of object-orientedobjectsdoes not include any of their associatedmethodswith which they were previously linked.

This process of serializing an object is also calledmarshallingan object in some situations.[1][2]The opposite operation, extracting a data structure from a series of bytes, isdeserialization, (also calledunserializationorunmarshalling)."
set,"(SLA), is a commitment between a service provider and a client. Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user.[195]The most common component of an SLA is that the services should be provided to the customer as agreed upon in the contract. As an example,Internet service providersandtelcoswill commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level(s) of service being sold in plain language terms. In this case the SLA will typically have a technical definition inmean time between failures(MTBF),mean time to repairormean time to recovery(MTTR); identifying which party is responsible for reporting faults or paying fees; responsibility for various data rates;throughput;jitter; or similar measurable details."
singleton variable,"Is anabstract data typethat can store unique values, without any particularorder. It is a computer implementation of themathematicalconcept of afinite set. Unlike most othercollectiontypes, rather than retrieving a specific element from a set, one typically tests a value for membership in a set."
software,"A variable that is referenced only once. May be used as a dummy argument in a function call, or when its address is assigned to another variable which subsequently accesses its allocated storage. Singleton variables sometimes occur because a mistake has been made – such as assigning a value to a variable and forgetting to use it later, or mistyping one instance of the variable name. Some compilers and lint-like tools flag occurrences of singleton variables."
software agent,"Computer software, or simply software, is a collection ofdataorcomputerinstructions that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast tophysical hardware, from which the system is built and actually performs the work. Incomputer scienceandsoftware engineering, computer software is allinformationprocessed bycomputer systems,programsanddata. Computer software includescomputer programs,librariesand related non-executabledata, such asonline documentationordigital media. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own."
software construction,"Is a computer program that acts for a user or other program in a relationship of agency, which derives from the Latinagere(to do): an agreement to act on one's behalf. Such ""action on behalf of"" implies theauthorityto decide which, if any, action is appropriate.[196][197]Agents are colloquially known asbots, fromrobot. They may be embodied, as when execution is paired with a robot body, or  as software such as a chatbot
executing on a phone (e.g.Siri)  or other computing device.  Software agents may be autonomous or work together with other agents or people.  Software agents interacting with people (e.g.chatbots,human-robot interactionenvironments) may possess human-like qualities such asnatural language understandingand speech, personality or embody humanoid form (seeAsimo)."
software deployment,"Is asoftware engineeringdiscipline. It is the detailed creation of working meaningfulsoftwarethrough a combination ofcoding,verification,unit testing,integration testing, anddebugging.

[in] a stylized software engineering process.""[201]"
software development process,"Is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing,programming,documenting,testing, andbug fixinginvolved in creating and maintainingapplications,frameworks, or other software components. Software development is a process of writing andmaintainingthesource code, but in a broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, sometimes in a planned andstructuredprocess.[202]Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.[203]"
software engineering,"Insoftware engineering, a software development process is the process of dividingsoftware developmentwork into distinct phases to improvedesign,product management, andproject management.  It is also known as a software development life cycle (SDLC).  The methodology may include the pre-definition of specificdeliverablesand artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application.[147]Most modern development processes can be vaguely described asagile. Other methodologies includewaterfall,prototyping,iterative and incremental development,spiral development,rapid application development, andextreme programming."

The software requirements specification lays outfunctionalandnon-functional requirements, and it may include a set ofuse casesthat describe user interactions that the software must provide to the user for perfect interaction."
sorting algorithm,"Is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about thequalityof thesoftwareproduct or service under test.[209]Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. Test techniques include the process of executing a program or application with the intent of findingsoftware bugs(errors or other defects), and verifying that the software product is fit for use."
source code,"Is analgorithmthat puts elements of alistin a certainorder. The most frequently used orders arenumerical orderandlexicographical order. Efficientsortingis important for optimizing theefficiencyof other algorithms (such assearchandmergealgorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful forcanonicalizingdata and for producing human-readable output. More formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:The output is in nondecreasing order (each element is no smaller than the previous element according to the desiredtotal order);The output is apermutation(a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.Further, the input data is often stored in anarray, which allowsrandom access, rather than a list, which only allowssequential access; though many algorithms can be applied to either type of data after suitable modification."
spiral model,"Incomputing, source code is any collection of code, with or withoutcomments, written using[210]ahuman-readableprogramming language, usually asplain text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computerprogrammers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by anassemblerorcompilerintobinarymachine codethat can be executed by the computer. The machine code might then be stored forexecutionat a later time. Alternatively, source code may beinterpretedand thus immediately executed."
stack,"Is a risk-drivensoftware development processmodel. Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements of one or more process models, such asincremental,waterfall, orevolutionary prototyping."
state,"Is anabstract data typethat serves as acollectionof elements, with two main principal operations:push, which adds an element to the collection, andpop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, apeekoperation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.[211]The name ""stack"" for this type of structure comes from the analogy to a set of physical items stacked on top of each other. This structure makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the stack may require taking off multiple other items first.[212]"
statement,"Ininformation technologyand computer science, a system is described as stateful if it is designed to remember preceding events or user interactions;[213]the remembered information is called the state of the system."
storage,"Incomputer programming, a statement is asyntacticunit of animperative programming languagethat expresses some action to be carried out.[214]Aprogramwritten in such a language is formed by a sequence of one or more statements. A statement may have internal components (e.g.,expressions)."
stream,Computer data storage is a technology consisting ofcomputercomponents andrecording mediathat are used to retain digitaldata. It is a core function and fundamental component of computers.[62]: 15–16
string,Is asequenceofdata elementsmade available over time. A stream can be thought of as items on aconveyor beltbeing processed one at a time rather than in large batches.
structured storage,"Incomputer programming, a string is traditionally asequenceofcharacters, either as aliteral constantor as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). A string is generally considered as adata typeand is often implemented as anarray data structureofbytes(orwords) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using somecharacter encoding.Stringmay also denote more generalarraysor other sequence (orlist) data types and structures."
subroutine,"A NoSQL (originally referring to ""non-SQL"" or ""non-relational"")[215]databaseprovides a mechanism forstorageandretrievalof data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used inrelational databases. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but the name ""NoSQL"" was only coined in the early 21st century,[216]triggered by the needs ofWeb 2.0companies.[217][218]NoSQL databases are increasingly used inbig dataandreal-time webapplications.[219]NoSQL systems are also sometimes called ""Not only SQL"" to emphasize that they may supportSQL-like query languages or sit alongside SQL databases inpolyglot-persistentarchitectures.[220][221]"

This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particulartaskshould be performed.Subroutines may be defined within programs, or separately inlibrariesthat can be used by many programs.  In different programming languages, a subroutine may be called a routine, subprogram, function,method, or procedure. Technically, these terms all have different definitions. The generic,umbrella termcallable unit is sometimes used.[162]"

Although computer algebra could be considered a subfield ofscientific computing, they are generally considered as distinct fields because scientific computing is usually based onnumerical computationwith approximatefloating point numbers, while symbolic computation emphasizesexactcomputation with expressions containingvariablesthat have no given value and are manipulated as symbols."
syntax error,"The syntax of acomputer languageis the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structuredstatementsorexpressionsin that language. This applies both toprogramming languages, where the document representssource code, and tomarkup languages, where the document represents data."
system console,"Is an error in thesyntaxof a sequence of characters ortokensthat is intended to be written incompile-time. A program will not compile until all syntax errors are corrected. Forinterpreted languages, however, a syntax error may be detected duringprogram execution, and an interpreter's error messages might not differentiate syntax errors from errors of other kinds. There is some disagreement as to just what errors are ""syntax errors"". For example, some would say that the use of an uninitialized variable's value in Java code is a syntax error, but many others would disagree[223][224]and would classify this as a(static) semanticerror."
technical documentation,"The system console, computer console, root console,operator's console, or simply console is the text entry and display device for system administration messages, particularly those from theBIOSorboot loader, thekernel, from theinitsystem and from thesystem logger. It is a physical device consisting of a keyboard and a screen, and traditionally is atext terminal, but may also be agraphical terminal. System consoles are generalized tocomputer terminals, which are abstracted respectively byvirtual consolesandterminal emulators. Today communication with system consoles is generally done abstractly, via thestandard streams(stdin,stdout, andstderr), but there may be system-specific interfaces, for example those used by the system kernel."
third-generation programming language,"In engineering, any type ofdocumentationthat describes handling, functionality, and architecture of a technical product or a product underdevelopmentor use.[225][226][227]The intended recipient for product technical documentation is both the (proficient)end useras well as the administrator/service or maintenance technician. In contrast to a mere ""cookbook""manual, technical documentation aims at providing enough information for a user to understand inner and outer dependencies of the product at hand."
top-down and bottom-up design,"A third-generation programming language (3GL) is ahigh-levelcomputerprogramming languagethat tends to be more machine-independent and programmer-friendly than themachine codeof thefirst-generationandassembly languagesof thesecond-generation, while having a less specific focus to thefourthandfifthgenerations.[228]Examples of common and historical third-generation programming languages areALGOL,BASIC,C,COBOL,Fortran,Java, andPascal."
tree,
type theory,"A widely usedabstract data type(ADT) that simulates a hierarchicaltree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with aparent node, represented as a set of linkednodes."
upload,"In mathematics, logic, and computer science, a type theory is any of a class offormal systems, some of which can serve as alternatives toset theoryas afoundation for all mathematics. In type theory, every ""term"" has a ""type"" and operations are restricted to terms of a certain type."
Uniform Resource Locator(URL),"Incomputer networks, to senddatato a remote system such as aserveror another client so that the remote system can store a copy.[229]Contrastdownload."
user,"A reference to aweb resourcethat specifies its location on acomputer networkand a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type ofUniform Resource Identifier(URI),[231][232]although many people use the two terms interchangeably.[233][c]URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications."
user agent,"Is a person who utilizes acomputerornetworkservice. Users of computer systems and software products generally lack the technical expertise required to fully understand how they work.[236]Power usersuse advanced features of programs, though they are not necessarily capable ofcomputer programmingandsystem administration."
user interface(UI),"Software (asoftware agent) that acts on behalf of auser, such as aweb browserthat ""retrieves, renders and facilitates end user interaction with Web content"".[237]An email reader is amail user agent."
user interface design,"The space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators'decision-makingprocess. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computeroperating systems, handtools,heavy machineryoperator controls, andprocesscontrols. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines asergonomicsandpsychology."
variable,"The design ofuser interfacesfor machines andsoftware, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus on maximizingusabilityand theuser experience. The goal of user interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible, in terms of accomplishing user goals (user-centered design)."
virtual machine(VM),"Incomputer programming, a variable, or scalar, is a storage location (identified by amemory address) paired with an associated symbolic name (anidentifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as avalue. The variable name is the usual way toreferencethe stored value, in addition to referring to the variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computersource codecan beboundto a value duringrun time, and the value of the variable may therefore change during the course ofprogram execution.[238][239]"
V-Model,"Anemulationof a computer system. Virtual machines are based oncomputer architecturesand attempt to provide the same functionality as a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of both."
waterfall model,"Asoftware development processthat may be considered an extension of thewaterfall model, and is an example of the moregeneral V-model. Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after thecodingphase, to form the typical V shape. The V-Model demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase oftesting. The horizontal and vertical axes represent time or project completeness (left-to-right) and level of abstraction (coarsest-grain abstraction uppermost), respectively.[240]"
Waveform Audio File Format,"A breakdown of project activities into linearsequentialphases, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialisation of tasks.  The approach is typical for certain areas ofengineering design. Insoftware development, it tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as progress flows in largely one direction (""downwards"" like awaterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation,analysis,design,construction,testing,deploymentandmaintenance."
web crawler,"Anaudio file formatstandard, developed byMicrosoftandIBM, for storing an audio bitstream onPCs. It is an application of theResource Interchange File Format(RIFF)bitstream formatmethod for storing data in ""chunks"", and thus is also close to the8SVXand theAIFFformat used onAmigaandMacintoshcomputers, respectively. It is the main format used onMicrosoft Windowssystems for raw and typically uncompressed audio. The usual bitstream encoding is thelinear pulse-code modulation(LPCM) format."
Wi-Fi,"AnInternet botthat systematically browses theWorld Wide Web, typically for the purpose ofWeb indexing(web spidering)."
